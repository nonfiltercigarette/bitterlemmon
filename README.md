Who would you choose to sell?

"Bitter Like A Lemmon 714" is a little Text Adventure Game, where you must sell them to the right person.
You can choose between three people. Mike, T and Luke. But choose wisely and don't let the names or the money influence you!



That's why the motto is "Who would you choose to sell?".
